# Tithe

Tithe is a modern web application for contributing to your favorite charity. It allows the user to choose a state and get a list of charities back for that state. Users can save and “spotlight” charities they like in a section that persists when the users leave the site. Tithe filters the charities returned by the Charity Navigator API to only return rated charities.

Technologies used

Tithe is sourced by the Charity Navigator and Google Maps Embed APIs. It uses Materialize for CSS styling, Firebase for data persistence (storage of spotlight charity info), and local storage to store the category ID parameter for the Charity Navigator API Ajax call that fetches the picture. It is written in the Javascript language using the JQuery library provided by a CDN provider.
